    "## Exercise 1\n",
    "Assume we have 1 dollar to be invested in two assets, whose return is modeled as a bivariate Gaussian distribution such that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Sigma = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "0.25 & 0.15 \\\\ 0.15 & 0.10\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "How much should we invest in each to minimize the overall variance in return with and without short selling? Answer this question solving the problem analytically and using a numerical code for constrained optimization problems. To simplify the problem, the acceptable baseline expected rate of return $m_b$ is $âˆ’\\infty$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analytical solution\n",
    "In this problem we have to minimize the variance with inequality constrains. This variance is computed in the following way $f(\\textbf{w}) = \\textbf{w}^\\top \\Sigma\\textbf{w}$ where each component of the vector $\\textbf{w}$ is the weight that the corresponding asset is going to have in our portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### With short selling\n",
    "\n",
    "The constrains that we have to take into account are $\\sum_i^nw_i=1$, this means that our weights must sum to 1. Now to solve the problem lets compute the function $f(\\textbf{w})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    f(\\textbf{w}) = \\begin{pmatrix} w_1 & w_2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.25 & 0.15 \\\\ 0.15 & 0.10 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} w_1 \\\\ w_2 \\end{pmatrix}= 0.25 w_1^2+0.3w_1w_2+0.1w_2^2=f(w_1,w_2).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With this function we have to solve a optimization problem in two dimensions but we can transform it by taking into account the constrain $w_1+w_2=1\\to w_1=1-w_2$. So if we substitute this in the original equation we get $f(w_2) = 0.05w_2^2-0.2w_2+0.25,$ that is a function of only one variable so to find its minimum we just have to derive it.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f'(w_2) = 0.1w_2-0.2.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And the minimum is achieved at $0.1w_2 = 0.2\\to w_2 = 2$. With this value of $w_2$ we get $w_1=-1$ and the solution is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\textbf{w} = \\begin{pmatrix}-1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With this solution we see that we have to short sell the first asset and then buy the second one.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Without short selling\n",
    "In this case we don't allow the weights to be negative, but the rest of the problem is the same. We have to implement the following constrains $w_1\\geq0$ and $w_2\\geq0$. Because $w_2$ is positive and $w_1=1-w_2$ is also positive we have that $w_2$ must be also less or equal than 1, so $w_2\\in[0,1]$. The absolute minimum from of the function $f(w_2)$, obtained in [the previous section](#with-short-selling), is not inside this region so because we know that this function only has an extrema point the minimum value inside the interval must be achieved at the boundaries.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So the minimum is at $w_2=1$ therefore $w_1$ must be 0.\n",
